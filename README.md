# kn-ps-apiserver-slack

Example Knative PowerShell function for sending CloudEvents emits by the Kubernetes Api Server to a Slack webhook. This function requires a deployed and working Knative [ApiServerSource](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sources/apiserversource/).

# Step 1 - Build

Create the container image locally to test your function logic. Change the IMAGE name accordingly, example below for Docker.

```console
export IMAGE=<docker-username>/kn-ps-apiserver-slack:1.0
docker build -t ${IMAGE}
```

# Step 2 - Test

Verify the container image works by executing it locally.

Change into the `test` directory

```console
cd test
```

Update the following variable names within the `docker-test-env-variable` file

* SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL - Slack webhook URL
* SLACK_MESSAGE_PRETEXT - Text displayed for Slack notification

Start the container image by running the following command:

```console
docker run -e FUNCTION_DEBUG=true -e PORT=8080 --env-file docker-test-env-variable -it --rm -p 8080:8080 ${IMAGE}
```

In a separate terminal, run either `send-cloudevent-test.ps1` (PowerShell Script) or `send-cloudevent-test.sh` (Bash Script) to simulate a CloudEvent payload being sent to the local container image

# Step 3 - Deploy

> **Note:** The following steps assume a working Knative environment using the RabbitMQ `broker` or the [MTChannelBasedBroker](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/brokers/broker-types/channel-based-broker/). The Knative `service` and `trigger` will be installed in the
`vmware-functions` Kubernetes namespace, assuming that the `broker` is also available there.
>

Update the `apiserver_slack_secret.json` file with your Slack webhook configurations and then create the Kubernetes secret which can then be accessed from within the function by using the environment variable named called `SLACK_SECRET`.

```console
# create secret

kubectl -n vmware-functions create secret generic apiserver-slack-secret --from-file=SLACK_SECRET=apiserver_slack_secret.json
```

Edit the `function.yaml` file with the name of the container image from Step 1 if you made any changes. If not, the default VMware container image will suffice. By default, the function deployment will filter on the `dev.knative.apiserver.resource.update` event. If you wish to change this, update the `type` field within `function.yaml` to the desired event type.

Furthermore, use the [Sockeye Event](https://github.com/n3wscott/sockeye) viewer to display all incoming events.

Deploy the function to the Knative environment.

```console
# deploy function

kubectl -n vmware-functions apply -f function.yaml
```

For testing purposes, the `function.yaml` contains the following annotations, which will ensure the Knative Service Pod will always run **exactly** one instance for debugging purposes.

```yaml
annotations:
  autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "1"
  autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "1"
```

# Step 4 - Undeploy

```console
# undeploy function

kubectl -n vmware-functions delete -f function.yaml

# delete secret
kubectl -n vmware-functions delete secret asop-slack-secret
```
